					Masahiro Sakurai is a japanese video game developer who originally worked for HAL Laboratories and then later Nintendo. He is best known for creating both the Kirby and Super Smash Bros. games. To respond to the criticism that fighting games at the time were too difficult for new players to get into, Sakurai came up with the idea for a platform fighter. This would allow new players to continue to fight even after taking several hits. He also sought to include both single player modes and advanced fighting techniques to appeal to both casual and competitive players.

					<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Dragon King: The Fighting Game</span></h1>
					<p><font size="+2"><span style="color: #ffffff;">
					After coming up with the original concept for his new style of fighting game, Sakurai worked with his mentor Satoru Iwata to develop a demo prototype. This prototype would be known in english as “Dragon King: The Fighting Game” and featured four basic humanoid characters duking it out on a floating platform. Not much known about this demo, since there was no footage released, but eventually it was decided that these generic fighters would be replaced with representatives from Nintendo’s most popular franchises.

					Some characters included: Mario, Donkey Kong, Kirby, and Fox McCloud. Nintendo's executives loved the idea when it was pitched and with that, the Super Smash Bros. series was born.

					<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">The Release of Smash Bros.</span></h1>
					<p><font size="+2"><span style="color: #ffffff;">
					Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64 was released to both critical and commercial success and contained content for both casual and competitive players, just as Sakurai intended. However, it would be several years before people began to realize how much competitive potential this series would have.
