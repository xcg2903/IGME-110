					<p><font size="+2"><span style="color: #ffffff;">
					Wavedashing is an advanced input that allows you to quickly slide across the ground by quickly dodging after you jump, allowing for faster and more fluid movement. The base movement speed of many characters in Melee is actually pretty lackluster surprisingly, making wavedashing an absolute necessity at high level play, especially today.  This, along with several other exploits of the system, were slowly discovered and utilized as the competitive community surrounding the game continued to grow. The incomprehensible amount of options and inputs that the game allowed you to utilize also made it so every individual player could form their own unique style.

					<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Unique Ways to Play</span></h1>
					<p><font size="+2"><span style="color: #ffffff;">
					Smash Bros differs from other fighting games in a very unique way. The platforming and advanced techniques allow you much more freedom in your options, especially when it comes to movement, when compared to traditional fighting games.  Chris “Wife” Fabiszak, one of the earliest competitive Melee players, discusses his experiences with this in The Smash Brothers, “There aren’t set combos, there aren’t a list where somebody somewhere decided what you can do, you can do whatever you want to with your character… while the video game is just a series of zeroes and ones, everybody looks different.

					<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">Conflicts with Nintendo</span></h1>
					<p><font size="+2"><span style="color: #ffffff;">
					Despite Melee’s extreme popularity as a competitive esport, they still had received virtually no support from their game’s parent company. Not only that, but with the release of Nintendo’s newest installment in the title, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the divide between Nintendo and the competitive scene became even more apparent. Advanced mechanics such as “wavedashing” and “L-cancelling” were removed entirely and every dash gave your character a random chance of tripping, which left you completely vulnerable to attack. All of these changes were made purposely to simply the game and lower it’s skill cap in comparison to Melee.
